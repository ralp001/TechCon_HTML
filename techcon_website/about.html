            <p>
                TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of local tech enthusiasts in a university lecture hall.
                Driven by a shared passion for innovation and knowledge exchange, it quickly grew into an annual
                event, drawing attendees and speakers from across the nation. Over the years, TechCon has been at the forefront
                of discussing emerging technologies, from the rise of mobile computing to the advent of AI.
